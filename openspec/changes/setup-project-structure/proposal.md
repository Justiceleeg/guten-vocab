# Change: Setup Project Structure

## Why
Establish the foundational project structure and repository organization to support the vocabulary recommendation engine. This creates the directory layout for backend, frontend, scripts, and data files before any implementation begins.

## What Changes
- Initialize Git repository
- Create project directory structure:
  - `backend/` - FastAPI application
  - `frontend/` - Next.js application
  - `scripts/` - Data generation and seeding scripts
  - `data/` - Static data files (vocab lists, mock data)
- Add README.md with project overview

## Impact
- Affected specs: None (infrastructure setup)
- Affected code: Project root structure, new directories
