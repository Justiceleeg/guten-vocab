# Change: Setup Frontend Infrastructure

## Why
Initialize the Next.js frontend application with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and required UI libraries. This establishes the React-based user interface foundation with modern tooling and component libraries for building the teacher dashboard.

## What Changes
- Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript in `frontend/` directory
- Install frontend dependencies (tailwindcss, axios, recharts)
- Configure Tailwind CSS
- Set up shadcn/ui component library
- Create basic layout with navigation
- Set up API client utilities

## Impact
- Affected specs: None (infrastructure setup)
- Affected code: `frontend/` directory, `package.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, `next.config.js`
