# Flourish Schools - Personalized Vocabulary Recommendation Engine
## Task List - Organized by Vertical Slices

---

## Project Overview
Build an AI-powered vocabulary recommendation system for middle school students that:
- Analyzes classroom transcripts and student essays
- Identifies vocabulary gaps per student
- Recommends books from Project Gutenberg based on vocabulary fit
- Provides teacher dashboard with student and class-wide insights

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js (React)
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- AI: OpenAI API
- NLP: spaCy (for lemmatization)
- Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Railway (backend + database)

**Key Constraints:**
- 1 classroom, 20-25 students (7th grade)
- Mock data only (no real student data)
- No authentication (MVP/demo)
- Pre-seeded database (analysis runs before deployment)

**Goal:** Generate personalized and class-wide book recommendations.

### Tasks:

#### 5.1 Student-Book Matching Algorithm
- [x] Create `scripts/generate_recommendations.py`
- [x] Implement matching logic:
  - For each student:
    - Get their vocabulary profile (known words from student_vocabulary)
    - Get their reading level
    - For each book:
      - Calculate vocabulary overlap:
        - Known words: words student has used correctly
        - New words: words in book but not in student's profile
        - Overlap percentage: known_words / total_vocab_words_in_book
      - Filter books by reading level:
        - Prefer books at student's level ± 1 grade
        - Allow higher if vocabulary fit is exceptional
      - Calculate match score:
        ```python
        # Goal: ~50% known, ~50% new for optimal challenge
        target_known_percent = 0.5
        known_percent = len(known_words) / len(book_vocab_words)
        
        # Penalize if too easy (>80% known) or too hard (<30% known)
        if known_percent > 0.8:
            penalty = (known_percent - 0.8) * 2
        elif known_percent < 0.3:
            penalty = (0.3 - known_percent) * 2
        else:
            penalty = 0
        
        # Reward books close to target
        closeness_to_target = 1 - abs(known_percent - target_known_percent)
        
        # Reading level match bonus
        reading_level_diff = abs(book.reading_level - student.reading_level)
        reading_level_score = max(0, 1 - (reading_level_diff / 2))
        
        match_score = (closeness_to_target * 0.6) + (reading_level_score * 0.3) - penalty
        match_score = max(0, min(1, match_score))  # Clamp to [0, 1]
        ```
      - Store top 3 books per student
- ✅ Result: Algorithm implemented and tested. Match scores calculated correctly with penalty system and reading level bonus.

#### 5.2 Store Student Recommendations

  - Insert top 3 recommendations into `student_recommendations` table:
    - student_id
    - book_id  
    - match_score
    - known_words_percent
    - new_words_count
- [x] Verify recommendations make sense (spot check a few students)
- ✅ Result: 75 recommendations stored (25 students × 3). Idempotent updates implemented. Verification confirms all students have appropriate recommendations.

#### 5.3 Class-Wide Recommendations
- [x] Aggregate student recommendations:
  - Count how many students have each book in their top 3
  - Calculate average match score per book across all students
  - Select top 2 books that appear most frequently in individual recommendations
  - Store in `class_recommendations` table:
    - book_id
    - match_score (average across students)
    - students_recommended_count
- ✅ Result: Top 2 class-wide recommendations identified and stored. "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" and "Mansfield Park" recommended to all 25 students.

#### 5.4 Run Recommendation Engine

  - Query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student_recommendations;` (should be 75 = 25 students × 3)
  - Query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM class_recommendations;` (should be 2)
  - Spot check: Do recommendations make sense for high/low proficiency students?
- ✅ Result: Recommendation engine executed successfully. All 75 student recommendations and 2 class recommendations verified in database. High/low proficiency students receive appropriate recommendations.

#### 5.5 Master Seed Script
- [x] Create `scripts/run_all.py`:
  - Runs all scripts in order:
    1. seed_vocabulary.py
    2. seed_books.py
    3. analyze_students.py (assumes mock data exists)
    4. generate_recommendations.py
  - Add error handling and logging
  - Print summary at end with all statistics

  - Match score calculation with known inputs
  - Penalty logic verification (too easy/hard books)
  - Reading level bonus verification
  - Edge case testing (0% mastery, 100% mastery, low/high coverage)
- [x] Data quality checks (`scripts/verify_recommendations.py`)

## Estimated Timeline

- **Slice 1 (Setup):** 1-2 days
- **Slice 2 (Vocab & Books):** 1-2 days (plus pgcorpus download time)
- **Slice 3 (Mock Data):** 1 day (mostly LLM generation wait time)
- **Slice 4 (Analysis):** 2-3 days
- **Slice 5 (Recommendations):** 1-2 days
- **Slice 6 (API):** 1 day
- **Slice 7 (Student View):** 2-3 days
- **Slice 8 (Class View):** 1-2 days
- **Slice 9 (Deployment):** 1 day
- **Slice 10 (Polish):** 1-2 days

**Total: ~14-20 days** (with buffer for debugging and refinement)

---

## Notes & Considerations

### Key Technical Decisions Made:
- Using OpenAI API instead of running models locally (faster for MVP)
- Using pgcorpus pre-computed counts instead of processing books ourselves (simpler)
- No lemmatization for books, only for student analysis (good enough for MVP)
- Pre-seeding database before deployment (no runtime data generation)
- No authentication (demo only)

### Potential Future Enhancements:
- Real-time transcript analysis (as class happens)
- Track vocabulary progress over time (multiple days)
- Student-facing interface (let students see their own progress)
- Integration with real classroom tools (Google Classroom, etc.)
- More sophisticated recommendation algorithm (collaborative filtering)
- Support for multiple classes/teachers
- Export reports as PDF

### Important Reminders:
- Commit vocab JSON files before starting
- Document which 100 books were selected
- Keep mock data realistic but not perfect (students make mistakes)
- Test with edge cases (very high/low proficiency students)
- The "through" vs "thorough" misuse should be subtle but detectable

---

- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed
- [ ] PostgreSQL 14+ installed (or Docker)
